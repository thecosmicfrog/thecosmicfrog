## Hi, I'm Aaron 🛫

I'm a Senior Cloud Platform Engineer working in travel tech and based in Dublin, Ireland ☘️

I'm currently working on an **internal developer platform (IDP)** that helps dev teams iterate quickly, deploy even quicker,
and get fast feedback ~when~ if it goes wrong. It's built with **Kubernetes**, **AWS**, **Argo CD**, **Datadog**,
**GitHub Actions**, and lots of other fun cloudy bits. It's all brought together with **Terraform/OpenTofu** and relentless
**CI/CD** to form a self-service **GitOps** platform. Our devs love it, and that's pretty neat.

Outside of work, I develop an open source Android app for **Luas**, Dublin's light rail system 🚊 called
**[Luas at a Glance](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thecosmicfrog.luasataglance)** (naming things was
never my strong suit).

When not doing something techy, I have a passion for ~flying fake airplanes~ **flight simulation**, particularly airliner
operations. I have a cobbled-together home cockpit based around the Airbus A320, and enjoy simulating real-world airline
operations: boarding passengers, loading fuel, scrutinising flight plans, dealing with systems failures, and ensuring
on-time departures for a fictional airline. Because it's... fun, I guess!
